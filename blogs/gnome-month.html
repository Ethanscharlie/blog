      <h2>Why I lost confidence in i3wm</h2>
      <p>
        After I first switched to i3wm a few years ago, I couldn't see how anybody could use a standard desktop environment. The speed and efficiency was incredible. But as time went on I started to miss the features of a full DE. As I started to get more busy I didn't have the time to configure my system, I just needed it to work. Little things like being unable to easily set default applications started to get to me. Having to use software like file explorers from other DE's felt stupid. Sure, I wasn't using Gnome or KDE. But I was using their software. And their software is made to integrate with their desktops. Because of avoiding these desktops, I was missing a lot of these features.

      <h2>Deciding on Gnome</h2>
      <p>
        Going into this I decided to either go with KDE Plasma, or Gnome. So why did I pick gnome? KDE is a buggy mess. After using it for an hour I couldn't take it anymore. KDE has so many little tiny annoying glitches and bugs I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

      <h2>The Good Parts</h2>
      <p>
        People say that gnome is hard to customize. I disagree. After instaing the Gnome extension manager cusomizing gnome was as easy as looking up what I wanted and installing it. Sure, making these extensions may not be as easy as cusomtizing KDE would be. But the beuty is that you don't have to make them. Gnome is very popluar, and I was able to find an extension that fit every feature I watned. Stuff like useless gabs, a syncthing icon, a mullvad icon, i3 style numbers for desktops. It took maybe an hour at most to get my system how I wanted it. With an i3 config file, this problably would've taken days. And thats not even mentioning the styling knowledge and skill it would take to make it look nice afterwards. Gnome extensions look great, no themeing required.

        Gnome isn't stupid. The features on the desktop aren't meant to copy Windows or Mac. They are meant to be usable and good. There are way to many little things to get into here. But in short, gnome has much better design then windows. In functionality and work speed.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bad Parts</h2>
      <p>
        I like tiling window managers. Stacking window managers are just worse. Sure, they may be better for people new to computers but I am clearly not one of those people. I was able to recreate something like this gnome using the useless gaps extension and the arrow key shortcuts to move windows. But it's not the same. It's not as natural. Most of the time it takes to much work so I just most my mouse and click. Which ends up being slower in the long run, but I'm lazy. I don't like alt-tab. Moving with HJKL in the direciton I want to go is soooo much better then alt-tabbing. Alt-tabbing never goes to the window I want to go to. So of course, I just end up using my mouse most of the time. Which is way slower.

      <h3>Battery Life</h3>
      <p>
        My laptops battery life averaged 49 minutes on gnome. I simply couldn't use it on my laptop.
      </p>

      <h2>So whats next?</h2>
      <p>
        On one hand, I really like the simpility and speed of Gnome (and all DE's really). Being able to add a feature to by system by installing a quick extension is so much nicer then having to figure out how to program it. But the functionality isn't their. The speed isn't there. Sure, adding new things is faster. But the speed at which I can work is slower. Maybe I just need to get more used to the new keybinds, but even if I do. They require more mental power to use. I need to focus on work, not on where I'm tabbing too. The time investment of tiling window managers is worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
        COSMIC may solve these problems, but I don't think it's going too. I don't think I can use a DE the way I fully want to. I need my computer to work my way, not the developers way. So I think I'm going to start a new system on Hyprland. I am going to try to recreate all the features I love about gnome. While keeping the productivity of my system. And also the battery life of my laptop, like holy shit it's a problem.
